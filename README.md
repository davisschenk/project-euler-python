This is my repository for keeping track of all problems I complete as a part of [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/).

## Goals
- Organize and keep track of all problems without hard coding them and then being able to automatically test all of my solutions
- Keeping all working solutions
- Use python and standard modules
    - I might also use libs like pandas, numpy and more_itertools
- Optimizing solutions to minimize time/space complexity. I would also like to eventually rank each solution using Big-O notation



##### DISCLAIMER: This repository contains answers and code for each of the problems I have completed.
