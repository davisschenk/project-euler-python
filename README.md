This is where I keep track of my solutions for Project Euler problems.

## What is Project Euler

> Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.

## Why

Project Euler contains many difficult mathematical and CS problems. This repository is a place where I am able to store all of the solutions I have created. While currently this is only Python I may later work on solutions in different programming languages.

## Goals

-   Build a custom set of tools that I can use to test the performance and validity of my solutions

-   Primarily use base python and modules from the standard lib. Though there are some other modules I might use, such as:
    -   Numpy
    -   Pandas
    -   more-itertools
    
-   Ensure that I am following python styling (PEP 8) and keeping code readable.
